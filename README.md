My solution for EA Software Engineer Virtual Experience program challenge using Python.

Alternative version of Pacman (Vaxman).

New rules and personal twists:

Rules:
Vaxman must kill all the ghosts by coming into contact with them (vaccinate).
Contact with a ghost does not kill Vaxman.
Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 20 seconds (the infection grows).
The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 8 times the original number.

Twists:
You are playing as the Slayer from Doom and instead of the original music it is the iconic "The Only Thing They Fear is You" from Doom Eternal:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_uXUXQFypc&ab_channel=AhmetOST.

The original source code is credited to https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman, and is edited to fit the new rules of the game. All other graphics and sounds can be found in the author's github repo.
